3. update functions to answer your specific needs

If you update the code, you can refers to 
[the issues](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/issues)
and do it in on the [branch v0.10.1](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/tree/v0.10.1) and/or the [branch v0.10.2](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/tree/v0.10.2)
so that the master branch remains unchanged for tests.
Anyhow, send me an email if you wish to participate in order to coordinate our efforts!

### 1. Test and report bugs

First, load the development version:

  `
  devtools::install_github("priviere/shinemas2R")
  `

The easiest way to start is to look at the vignette to know how the package works.

You can see the vignette [here](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/blob/master/vignettes/shinemas2R.pdf). You can download it by clicking on 'Raw' in the top right corner.

Do not hesitate to let a message [in the issues](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/issues) or to send me an email if some points are not clear in the vignette or you find bugs.


### 2. Translate

The package is in english. 
Every contributions to other languages are welcome!
More information on R package translation [here](http://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html).

### 3. Update functions to answer your specific needs
You can update `format.data` [here](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/blob/master/R/format.data.R) in order to format data for existing R packages.
Note that the output of the R packages must be a ggplot object to be taken by `get.pdf`.

You may want new query types (`get.data` [here](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/blob/master/R/get.data.R)), 
new plots (`get.ggplot` [here](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/blob/master/R/get.ggplot.R)) or 
new tables (`get.table` [here](https://github.com/priviere/shinemas2R/blob/master/R/get.table.R)) 
to answer your specific needs.
